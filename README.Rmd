# LINDA Package: 

`LINDA` is an R package for automatic segmentation of **chronic** stroke lesions.  
The method is described in [Hum Brain Mapp. 2016
Apr;37(4):1405-21](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hbm.23110/abstract).  

-----

## Requirements:  

* Linux or Mac (since Oct 2016 ANTsR [can run in
Windows 10](https://github.com/stnava/ANTsR/wiki/Installing-ANTsR-in-Windows-10-\(along-with-FSL,-Rstudio,-Freesurfer,-etc\).))  
* [R v3.0 or above](http://www.r-project.org/)  
* The [ANTsR](http://stnava.github.io/ANTsR/) package installed in R
* A T1-weighted MRI of a patient with (left hemispheric) stroke

-----

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>",
  fig.path = "man/figures/README-"
)
if (requireNamespace("git2r")) {
  repo = git2r::repository(".")
  url = git2r::remote_url(repo, remote = "origin") 
  gh_user = basename(dirname(url))
} else {
  gh_user = "dorianps"
}
```


## Installation:

##### Method 1 (easy, incomplete)
This method does not require any prep on your side, just paste the lines below and all required packages will (hopefully) be installed (including ANTsR). However, MNI transformations are not included because Github does not accept big files. You can still force on the fly registrations to MNI (ch2) space by  setting `saveMNI=TRUE`. If you frequently need outputs in MNI space, use Method 2 below.  

``` r
install.packages('devtools')
devtools::install_github('dorianps/LINDA', upgrade_dependencies=FALSE)
```


##### Method 2 (complex, complete)
This method includes the MNI transformations, but works only if you have previously installed ANTsR. To do that, try:
``` r
devtools::install_github('ANTsX/ANTsR')
```  
Then download the [latest
LINDA release v0.5.0](https://github.com/dorianps/LINDA/releases/download/0.5.0/LINDA_v0.5.0.zip) and install from command line:
``` bash

wget https://github.com/dorianps/LINDA/releases/download/0.5.0/LINDA_v0.5.0.zip
unzip LINDA_v0.5.0.zip # this will unzip to LINDA folder
R CMD INSTALL LINDA # install the LINDA folder in R
```



## Run:
``` r
library(LINDA)
filename = '/path/to/patient/T1.nii.gz'
outputs = linda_predict(filename)
```

If you don't specify a filename, a file dialog will allow you to choose the T1 nifti file of the patient.

``` r
outputs = linda_predict()
```

LINDA will run and you will see the timestamp of the various steps. 
Results will be saved in a folder named “linda” in the same path where the T1 is located. The location of these files will be returned in R (i.e., in the `outputs` variable).

If the "linda" folder contains segmentations from an earlier run, processing will stop immediately. Use `cache=FALSE` to force overwriting the old files. If processing is interrupted and restarted, LINDA will use the existing files in the "linda" folder to start where it was interrupted.



**Available prediction models:**  
*Currently a model trained on 60 patients from Penn is used. The
internal prediction engine works with 2mm voxel resolution. This does
not mean your images need to be 2mm, any resolution should work.*

Wonder what to expect? Check individual results from our [60 patients
Penn
dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxHeqEv37qqDT085MHAyMzFJcVk)
and [45 patients Georgetown
dataset](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BxHeqEv37qqDY1psaC14QXZSOXc).  
Our users have reported quite good lesion segmentations for typical
large stroke lesions, but less accurate segmentations with tiny lesions.

**Important Note**  
MNI is a space, not a template. There are many templates in MNI space,
most of which do not have the same gyri or sulci at the same
coordinates. LINDA uses the CH2 template which is included in LINDA.
Please don’t use other MNI templates to overlay results. They may look
good from a first look, but they will be wrong. Use the CH2 template
that comes with LINDA. In alternative, you can register the CH2 template
to another template (i.e., ICBM 2009a) and transform back and forth the
results as necessary.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**- What file formats are accepted**?  
Nifti images (.nii and .nii.gz) are accepted. Earlier LINDA versions did not accept other formats, but now any format can be read. Note that the Analyze format has unclear left-right orientation.  
**- Can I use it with right hemispheric lesions?**  
Yes, but you need to flip the L-R orientation before. After that, the
prediction will work just as well.  
**- Can I use it with bilateral lesions?**  
It will likely be less accurate. One of the features LINDA uses is the
left-right signal asymmetry.  
**- Can I use it to segment acute and subacute stroke lesions?**  
No, the current model is trained only on chronic stroke patients. It
might be possible to segment acute stroke with models trained on acute
data.  
**- Can I use other images: FLAIR, T2, DWI?**  
No, the existing model accepts only T1w. In principle, additional models
can be built from other modalities (T2, FLAIR, DWI).  
**- Can I train a model with my own data?**  
This is perfectly doable, but the training script is not available
online (needs some work to adapt it for widepsread use). If you want the
example script used for the current model, I can send it easily, just
contact me.  
**- Can I use LINDA to obtain registrations in MNI?**  
The transfer in MNI is obtained by concatenating transformations
“Subject” -\> “Penn Template” -\> “ch2 MNI template”. Thus there are
two sources of potential error. The second source of error is fixed for
all subjects because our template has always the same registration on
MNI. However, a fixed error is always an error. If you really want
precise registration on MNI, I advise to register directly the subject
to an MNI template (possibly using a group MNI template rather than the
ch2).  
**- Will you maintain LINDA and publish new models in the future?**  
There is no plan, time, or funding to do this at this time. If other
researchers want to contribute, this can be done easily because LINDA is
open source.

## Support:

The best way to keep track of bugs or failures is to open a [New
Issue](https://github.com/dorianps/LINDA/issues) on the Github system. If the algorithm proceeds without errors but the automatic segmentation is erroneous, please send (i) your T1 image and (ii) the segmentation produced by LINDA in native space. Try also overlaying `Mask.lesion*.nii.gz` files on the T1 to check whether the brain mask is wrong somewhere.  
  
Subscribe to <LINDA-tools+subscribe@googlegroups.com> to send support requests and get notified of new versions.
